# SpeechRecognitionProject

In this project, I learned how to do speech recognition easily in python. I used the speech_recognition, pyaudio, and portaudio modules. It's incredibly easy to do simple speech-to-text operations. There are many applications I see for this tech. I will be doing more with password access in the future, and I would like to learn more about speech profiles and individual voice recognition as well.
